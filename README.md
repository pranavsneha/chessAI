# chessAI
Right now, this project is in the VEEEEEEEEEEEERY early stages. So far, it connects to chess.js, and renders a board, but that is it.



Things that need to be added:
1. Selecting and moving pieces.
2. check if move is valid
3. do game checks. (at this point, it should be a regular chess game)
4 Minimax!!!! then
5. add alpha beta pruning

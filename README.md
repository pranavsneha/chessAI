chessAI
Right now, this project is in the VEEEEEEEEEEEERY early stages. So far, it connects to chess.js, and renders a board, but that is it.

Things that need to be added:

Selecting and moving pieces.
check if move is valid
do game checks. (at this point, it should be a regular chess game) 4 Minimax!!!! then
add alpha beta pruning
